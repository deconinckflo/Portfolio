      date : "June 2020"
      category : "Logistic Regression"
      link: https://github.com/Thrynk/Tennis-prediction
      intro: This is my first project in Data Science. I’m a fan of tennis, after practicing during 7 years. I missed the court. What could be more interesting than studying Data Science with a little bit of nostalgia. We tried to answer Can tennis outcomes be predicted thanks to data available on the internet ?
      para: I did this project with a friend of mine. We had 3 weeks to do the analysis and create a dashboard on a website to see latest tweets regarding tennis, see different results of tennis matches and link our predictions to it. We reached an accuracy of 65% by using elo rating of player in a Logistic Regression. That is a good score already but we then tried to do a more deeper analysis.
      para2 : We tried to compute more features to see if we can beat this accuracy. We performed different steps to reach our goal, Data collection, Data cleaning, Feature scaling, Feature Engineering, Feature selection and Recursive feature elimination.
