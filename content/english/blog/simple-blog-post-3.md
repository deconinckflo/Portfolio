description : "Project to build a Deep Learning AI that recognize if human has a safety mask or not, and if this mask is well placed"
---

The health crisis of COVID-19 (known as Coronavirus) striking the whole world, forced everybody to wear a mask. Besides governments efforts, the virus is still spreading. Indeed, some people don't wear their mask properly. In this project, we will propose to solve this problem with Deep Learning. Our algorithm will detect if someone wears or not a mask and if yes, if it is well worn.

In this Master I project, we are a team of 5 students, and we are challenged to program an AI that will understand thanks to a photo if a human is wearing a safety mask or not, but also if this safety mask is well-worn

This project will help me discover Neural Networks, and Computer Vision.

There is not much content now, because we just started the project. But I will update this project page during the project, so stay in touch !
