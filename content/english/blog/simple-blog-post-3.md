description : "Project to build a Deep Learning AI that recognize if human has a safety mask or not, and if this mask is well placed"
---

In this school project, we are a team of 5 students, and we are challenged to program an AI that will understand thanks to a photo if a human is wearing a safety mask or not, but also if this safety mask is well-worn

This project will help me discover Neural Networks, and Computer Vision.

There is not much content now, because we just started the project. But I will update this project page during the project, so stay in touch !
