description : "Build an AI that plays dots and boxes"
---

This project is part of my Master I in Big Data. We have to program an AI playing the game Dots and Boxes. Our AI will be evaluated in a tournament where all the AI of the class are attending.

This project is part of the course of artificial intelligence in which we studied linear regression, decision trees, the K-NN algorithm and neural networks.

Iâ€™m currently programming a handmade algorithm, and after that I will train a Reinforcement Learning AI against my algorithm.

There is not much content now, because I just started the project. But I will update this project page during the project, so stay in touch !
