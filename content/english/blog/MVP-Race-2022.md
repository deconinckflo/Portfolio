## Introduction
Like every end of season in NBA, it is time to give the individual trophies. The NBA designates, by a vote of the journalists, the players who were the most deserving in each specialty, the best player, the best defender, the best coach, the best sixth man, the player who has improved the most and the rookie of the year. They are referred to as MVP, DPOY, Coach of the Year, Best 6th Man, MIP and ROY.

Being a basketball fan and having followed with great interest this 2021-2022 NBA season, I was interested in the statistics of the two favorites to win the MVP (Most Valuable Player) award, Nikola JOKIC and Joel EMBIID.

## Objectif
My goal is to make two dashboards, one for each player, showing the performances and the impact they had during this season. In addition to the fact that I'm going to dive deeper into the statistics of these two players, this exercise is an opportunity for me to **develop my skills and my know-how in Data Visualization**.

## Realisation
To build this dashboard, I discovered and learned how to use **Tableau**. It's a visual analytics platform that transforms the way data is used to solve problems. It empowers users to take full advantage of their data. So here are the two dashboards I made:
