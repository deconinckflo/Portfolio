## Introduction
Ovarian cancer, is one of the most common types of cancer in women. The symptoms are not always easy to recognise because they're similar to those of some more common conditions.

In this Master I project, we are a team of 6 students, and we are challenged to create an AI in order to predict if a patient is cancerous or not.

## Dataset
For this project, data from cancer patients and non-sick patients were provided to us by the Centre Oscar Lambret and the Centre Hospitalier RÃ©gional Universitaire de Lille.

## Method
We have chosen to build several models:
- 1D CNN
- 2D CNN
- MLP

This project remains fairly confidential because it is still in progress today.
